Scripts for the Diverse Genders and Sexualities (DGS) Pilot Study

Information on each file:
- Experimental analyses = RMD file with code for the experimental analyses for the DGS 'This is Me' task paper. Data includes participants who completed session 2 (i.e., the experimental group) only
- Questionnaires_DGS = RMD file with code for scoring all of the measures used in the DGS 'This is Me' task paper. Data includes all participants and all versions of the DHEQ. Some measures are included which did not make it onto the final paper (e.g., CTQ, CTSM). 
- Questionnaires_experimental = RMD file with code for scoring all of the measures used in the DGS 'This is Me' task paper. Data includes participants who completed session 2 (i.e., the experimental group) only. Only scoring for version 3 of the DHEQ is included here. Some measures are included which did not make it onto the final paper (e.g., CTQ, CTSM), but these are not included in the final database export (which is what is used for the Experimental Analyses file).
- Questionnaires_experimental_ALL_DHEQ_VER = RMD file with code for scoring all of the measures used in the DGS 'This is Me' task paper. Data includes participants who completed session 2 (i.e., the experimental group) only. Scoring for all versions of the DHEQ is included, be wary some errors may exist with this code.
